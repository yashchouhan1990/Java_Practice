Value of num = 100
Value of mystr = Constructor

Explanation:
Static block gets executed when the class is loaded in the memory. A class can have multiple Static blocks, 
which are executed in the same sequence in which they have been written into the program.
Note: Static Methods can access class variables without using object of the class. Since constructor is 
called when a new instance is created so firstly the static blocks are called and after that the constructor is called. 
If we would have run the same program without using object, the constructor would not have been called.
