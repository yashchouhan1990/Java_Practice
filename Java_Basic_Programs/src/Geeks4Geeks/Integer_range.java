Explanation: In the source code of Integer object we will find a method ‘valueOf’ in which we can see that the range 
of the Integer object lies from IntegerCache.low(-128) to IntegerCache.high(127). Therefore the numbers above 127 
will not give the expected output. The range of IntegerCache can be observed from the source code of the IntegerCache class. 
Please refer this for details.
